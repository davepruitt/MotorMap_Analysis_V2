# MotorMap_Analysis_V2

This is a second set of motor map analysis code that I wrote for a different style of motor mapping procedure compared to my first set of analysis code. Primarily, this code allows for a larger set of movement classifications, classifying a single site as multiple movements, and classifying sites according to either short-duration or long-duration cortical stimulation. It also allows for bilateral motor maps.

This code, in its current state, does not have any built-in plotting features. However, it does load the data into a nice structured format for easy analysis. Mapping data must be entered by hand into an Excel spreadsheet either during the motor map procedure or afterwards. It is then loaded into Matlab using this code for analysis purposes. A small amount of example data has been provided for reference.

Feel free to use this code, and direct any questions towards myself.
